Here is the Python code and its output:

```python
total = 0
for i in range(10000):
    term = 1 / (2 * i + 1)  # Generate odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: add
        total += term
    else:  # Odd index: subtract
        total -= term

result = total * 4
print(result)
```

Output:
