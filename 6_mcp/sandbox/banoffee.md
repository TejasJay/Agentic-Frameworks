### Description

### Ingredients
- **Crust:**
  - 1 and 1/2 cups (180g) graham cracker crumbs (about 12 full sheet graham crackers)
  - 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
  - 6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted

- **Filling:**
  - 1 and 1/4 cups dulce de leche
  - 2 large bananas, sliced

- **Whipped Cream:**
  - 2 cups (480ml) cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
  - 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar or granulated sugar*
  - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
2. **Make the crust:** In a medium bowl, stir together graham cracker crumbs and sugar, then stir in melted butter. Pour into a 9-inch pie dish and pat down.
3. Bake the crust for 15 minutes and cool for 15 minutes.
4. **For the whipped cream:** Using a mixer, whip the cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes.
5. Spread dulce de leche on top of the cooled crust. Arrange banana slices in 1-2 layers on top, then spread whipped cream on top.
6. Refrigerate pie for at least 2 hours. Garnish with toppings before serving.
7. **Notes:** You can make the dulce de leche from sweetened condensed milk if desired.
